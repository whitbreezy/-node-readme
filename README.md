# Professional README Generator

## Description

This project is intended to help users create a professional readme by answering a few prompts from the command line. It takes the user's input and creates a readme.md file using that data. By using this method, the user won't have to create a readme from scratch every time they want to start a new web development project.

## Installation

Clone or Fork from my github repo: https://github.com/whitbreezy/readme-generator

Once you have the code in your machine locally, you can run the command 'node index.js' to bring up the readme generator prompts and create a readme file. 

Note: Node.js is needed in order to run this code from the command line. 

## Usage

Once the code is on your machine locally, you can run node index.js to bring up and answer the prompts. The prompt answers you entered are then used to create a readme.md file in the directory being used.
